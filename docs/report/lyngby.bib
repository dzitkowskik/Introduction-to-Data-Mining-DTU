% the title (e.g., not "the", "a" or "on")
% If the name or the title contain two words connected by "-" then
% both words are used:

% Allan Smith-Jones, "A Non-linear analysis of fMRI", 1995.
%
% Becomes: SmithJonesA1995NonLinear
%
% Older entries are without initials: SmithJones1995NonLinear
%
% A few entries are with full first name: SmithJonesAllan1995NonLinear
